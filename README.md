# Keycloak Cheatsheets

Welcome to the Keycloak Cheatsheets repository, a comprehensive guide and collection of configurations to help you integrate Keycloak for authentication and authorization in various platforms and applications.

## About Keycloak

Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Access Management solution aimed at modern applications and services. It offers out-of-the-box support for many standard protocols such as OpenID Connect (OIDC), OAuth 2.0, and SAML.

This project aims to simplify the complexity around configuring Keycloak with different systems by providing easy-to-follow guides and cheatsheets.

## Getting Started

### Available Integration Guides

- [**ArgoCD with Keycloak Integration Guide**](argocd/README.md) - Step-by-step instructions on integrating ArgoCD with Keycloak using OIDC for authentication.

We are actively working on adding more guides to cover a wide range of applications and services. If you don't see a guide for your specific need, please consider contributing.
